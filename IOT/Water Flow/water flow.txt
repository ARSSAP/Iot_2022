Introduction
This Gravity: liquid flow sensor is designed based on the electromagnetic principle. It adopts O-ring rubber seal and uses silicone sealant at the outlet end to strength water-resistance. With high anti-interference and anti-impact, the sensor offers reliable performance and long service life. Also, it is designed with G3/4 thread connectors for easy installation.
The sensor can be used with microcontrollers like Arduino UNO to measure the flow of liquids with high concentration and low viscosity like water, diesel, engine oil, milk, paint, detergent, honey, etc. (no impurity in liquid)
